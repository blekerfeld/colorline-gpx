# ColorLine GPX Tool Oslo - Kiel
Tool I created in 2013, to get ready-to-use gpx files to geotag photos made on the ColorLine route Kiel-Oslo and Oslo-Kiel. Provided as is.

The idea behind this tool is to make it simple to geotag photos made on this route. As the route and time schedule of the ships do not differ that much from day to day, this is enough for approximate geo-tagging, it will of course not be 100% right. Note: the tool uses a base-route ripped from a marine tracker tool in 2013, I have no idea if this route still is correct, chances are nothing changed.
